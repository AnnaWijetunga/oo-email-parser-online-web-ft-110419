# Build a class EmailParser that accepts a string of unformatted 
# emails. The parse method on the class should separate them into
# unique email addresses. The delimiters to support are commas (',')
# or whitespace (' ').


# initialize with a list of email addresses
# emails are separated with spaces or commas
# parse method should only return unique addresses
